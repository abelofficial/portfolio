# Portfolio website

This is a personal website to showcase my work and daily activities. The website is made using [Nextjs v.12](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12) and [Material-UI v.5](https://mui.com/blog/mui-core-v5/). Currently the website shows my daily activities on github as well as previous work experiences, timeline, and my tech stacks.

## Findings

While doing this project I have learned so much on how to use the newest version Nextjs (v.12) with the newest version of material ui (V.5). The pre-configurations could be tricky however, by following [this suggestion solution](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/nextjs) from Material-ui i was able to configure it. I also handled page route animation using [Framer-motions](https://www.framer.com/docs/).

## Running project

- `npm run lint && npm run dev`

## Notes

All images are in the SVG format and color changes are done programmatically. The images can be found inside `/src/components/collections` folder. All text contents are defined in the directory `/src/static` as JSON format.

## Browser Support

Currently, This site officially aim to support the last two versions of the following browsers:
